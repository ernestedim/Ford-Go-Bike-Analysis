## Eploratory Visualization of Ford Go-Bike Dataset

### DATASET

Ford Go-Bike data from 2019 covers details of individual rides made in the bike Club system comprised by mostly the San Francisco Bay area. Many other cities are covered by the complete dataset. There are data for previous years as well, but I will be working on San Francisco. The data comprises 16 columns namely: duration_sec, start_time, end_time, start_station_id, start_station_name, start_station_latitude, start_station_longitude, end_station_id, end_station_name, end_station_latitude, end_station_longitude, bike_id, user_type, member_birth_year, member_gender, bike_share_for_all_trip and 183412 observations.

### Summary of Findings

While exploring the dataset, I discovered a few things of interest. They include:
- The dataset only conprised trips taken in february 2019
- The days of the week affected how many trips/rides were taken and their duration. 
- There are more trips taken during the days of Thursdays and Tuesdays than other days. Weekends being the least.
- The time spent riding were higher during weekends (Saturdays and Sundays).
- Users who are subscribers are more in number than users who are customers.
- Trips were mostly taken during the hours of 17:00 (5PM) and 8:00 (8AM) than other hours. 
- Customers more than subcribers took the highest average ride time during weekends.

### Key Insights for Presentation

>For this presentation, my focus was drawn to the distribution of rides by all users across hours of the day. I further looked into into the relationship between member ages and duration of trips taken. Then I checked the hourly Usage of bikes for rides according to user types. Finally, I concluded with understanding the average biking duration for each user type according to day of the week.
